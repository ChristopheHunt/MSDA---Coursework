Body girth measurements and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender, are given for 507 physically active individuals - 247 men and 260 women. These data can be used to provide statistics students practice in the art of data analysis. Such analyses range from simple descriptive displays to more complicated multivariate analyses such as multiple regression and discriminant analysis.

Data come from ``Exploring Relationships in Body Dimensions" by Peterson, Johnson, and Kerk published in Journal of Statistics Education Volume 11, Number 2 (2003).
