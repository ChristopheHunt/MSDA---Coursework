# Problem Set 1

## Problem 1 

What is the rank of the matrix A?


\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 &4  \\
   -1 & 0 & 1 & 3  \\
   0 & 1 & -2 & 1   \\
   5 & 4 & -2 & -3   \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

## Problem 2 

Given an mxn matrix where $m > n$, what can be the maximum rank? The minimum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?

## Problem 3 

What is the rank of matrix B?

\[
B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 2 & 1 \\
   3 & 6 & 3 \\
   2 & 4 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

# Problem Set 2 

Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix A. You'll need to show your work. You'll need to write out the characteristic polynomial and show your solution.

\[
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 2 & 3 \\
   0 & 4 & 5 \\
   0 & 0 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
