# Problem Set 1 

## (1) Calculate the dot product $u.v$ where $u = [0.5; 0.5]~and~v = [3; -4]$

```{r, cache=TRUE}
u <-  c(.5, .5)
v <-  c(3 ,-4)

dotProduct <- function(x, y)
if (length(x) != length(y)){
  return("vectors are not equal lengths")
  } else {
    product <- c()
      for (i in 1:length(x)){
           product <- append(product, (x[[i]] * y[[i]]))
       }
  return(sum(product))
}

dotProduct(u,v)
```

\newpage

## (2) What are the lengths of $u$ and $v$? 
Please note that the mathematical notion of the length of a vector is not the same as a computer science definition.

```{r, cache=TRUE, results='asis'}
u <-  c(.5, .5)
v <-  c(3 ,-4)

print(paste0("the length of $u$ = ", round(sqrt(dotProduct(u,u)), 2)))
print(paste0("the length of $v$ = ", round(sqrt(dotProduct(v,v)), 2)))
```


## (3) What is the linear combination: $3u - 2v$?

```{r, cache=TRUE}
u <-  c(.5, .5)
v <-  c(3 ,-4)

linearCombo <- function(xMulti, x, yMulti, y, subtract = TRUE){
      xResults  <- c()
      yResults  <- c()
      linCombo <- c()
    for (i in 1:length(x)){  
      xResults <- append(xResults, (xMulti * x[[i]]))
    }
    for (i in 1:length(y)){ 
      yResults <- append(yResults, (yMulti* y[[i]]))
    }
    if (subtract == TRUE){ 
    for (i in 1:length(xResults))
      linCombo <- append(linCombo, (xResults[[i]] - yResults[[i]]))
    } else {
    for (i in 1:length(xResults))
      linCombo <- append(linCombo, (xResults[[i]] - yResults[[i]]))
    }
    return(linCombo)
}

x <- linearCombo(xMulti = 3, u, yMulti = 2, v)

paste0("[",x[1], " , " , x[2], "]")
```

## (4) What is the angle between $u$ and $v$

```{r, cache=TRUE}
angle <- acos((dotProduct(u,v) / (sqrt(dotProduct(u,u)) * sqrt(dotProduct(v,v)))))
angle
```



# Problem Set 2 

Set up a system of equations with 3 variables and 3 constraints and solve for x. Please write a function in R that will take two variables (matrix A & constraint vector b) and solve using elimination. Your function should produce the right answer for the system of equations for any 3-variable, 3-equation system. You don't have to worry about degenerate cases and can safely assume that the function will only be tested with a system of equations that has a solution. Please note that you do have to worry about zero pivots, though. Please note that you should not use the built-in function solve to solve this system or use matrix inverses. The approach that you should employ is to construct an Upper Triangular Matrix and then back-substitute to get the solution. Alternatively, you can augment the matrix A with vector b and jointly apply the Gauss Jordan elimination procedure.
