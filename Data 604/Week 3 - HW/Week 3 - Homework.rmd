Chapter 3

## Problem 1

> Extend the simulation of throwing two dice in Section 3.2.1 in each of the following ways (one at a time, not cumulatively).

### a. Instead of 50 throws, extend the spreadhseet to make 500 throws and compare your results. Tap the F9 key to get a "fresh" set of randome numbers and thus a fresh set of results. 

```{r}

```

### b. Load the dice by changing the probabilites of the faces to be something other than uniform at 1/6 for each face. Be careful to exam that your probabilties sum to 1.

```{r}

```

### c. Use @RISK or another Excel add-in for status Monte Carlo, spreadsheet simulatoin, to make 10,000 thrwos of the pair of fair dice, and compare your results to the true probabilities of getting the sum equal to each of 2,3,...12 as well as to the true expected value of 7.
