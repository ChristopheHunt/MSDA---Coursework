2. Modify Model 9-1 to support preemption of the Doctor resource for Urgent Patients. In particular, if all doctors are busy when an Urgent patient arrives, the Urgent patient should preempt a doctor from one of the other non-Urgent patients. Compare the results of the models. Would you advise that the emergency department make the corresponding change in the real system.

> The instructions for an interruption process yieled the same results. We can implement this change as it has no discernable impact on processing. I am concerned that this is more of an issue related to the unintuitive nature of Simio than this process having no actual impact so I look forward to any feedback.
