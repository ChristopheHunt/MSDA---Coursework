### For an M/M/1 queue with mean interarrival time 1.25 minutes and mean service time 1 minute, find all five $W_q, W, L_q, L$, and $p$. for each interpret in words. Be sure to state all your units, and the relevant time frame of operation.

* $\mu = 1~minute=\frac{1}{E(S)}$ 
* $\lambda = \frac{1}{1.25}~minutes~=~0.8~minutes$.

As per our text book, "the steady-state average number in system is $L=\frac{p}{(1-p)}$ and  $p$ is the mean arrival rate $\lambda$ divded by the mean service rate $\mu$ for a single server". Therefore, $p = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ or $p = \frac{.8}{1}$ then substitute that to solve for $L$, $L = \frac{.8}{(1-0.8)} = 4$

* $p = .8$

* $L = 4$

### Little's Law 

We now use Little's Law to solve for the remaining values. 

* $L = \lambda W$; $4 = .8 W$;  $W = 5$

* $W = W_q + E(S)$; $5 = W_q + 1$; $W_q = 4$

* $L_q = \lambda W_q$; $L_q = 0.8 * 4$; $L_q = 3.2$
