1.  For each of the following series (from the fma package), make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect.

a. Monthly total of people on unemployed benefits in Australia (January 1956-July 1992).
Monthly total of accidental deaths in the United States (January 1973-December 1978).
Quarterly production of bricks (in millions of units) at Portland, Australia (March 1956-September 1994).
Hints:
data(package="fma") will give a list of the available data.
To plot a transformed data set, use plot(BoxCox(x,0.5)) where x is the name of the data set and 0.5 is the Box-Cox parameter.

Consider the daily closing IBM stock prices (data set ibmclose).
Produce some plots of the data in order to become familiar with it.
Split the data into a training set of 300 observations and a test set of 69 observations.
Try various benchmark methods to forecast the training set and compare the results on the test set. Which method did best?
