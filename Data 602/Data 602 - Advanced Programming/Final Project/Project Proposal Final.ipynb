    "In this project, I will be analyzing a moderately large data set (~790mb)  provided by Iowa's [Alcoholic Beverages Division](https://abd.iowa.gov/division) on spirit purchases from January 1, 2012 to current. The data set has time stamped store level information which will allow for both a geo-spatial analysis of purchases by region and a time series analysis of purchases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform this analysis, I will need to utilize several different technologies. I will be using a NoSQL solution of MongoDB to store the raw data. Then I will use Numpy and Pandas to transform the raw data into a useful format, including any other relevant python module. Finally, I will use Plotly and any other python visualization techniques to illustrate the insights discovered in the analysis section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, my main goal for this project is to gain a deeper level of understanding in using python to analyize geographic information and time series data. My secondary goals will be to learn to process information efficiently with python as this data set is relatively large and to discover one meaningful insight about the data. I hope that through this project, I will eventually be able to translate the work to a real world appliaction as geographic information of purchases has obvious commerical value. "
