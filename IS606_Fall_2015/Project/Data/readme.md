Caveats:
"1. The phrase 'Not Reported' is shown when the specific disease was not reported for the given location and year. The phrase"
"'Not Applicable' is shown when the denominator population is not on record, or when the rate cannot be calculated due to lack of"
"disease incidence count or lack of denominator population."
"2. Prior to 2003, some reporting entities reported summary cases through paper forms. Reporting entities differed in their"
"ability to reconcile differences in total cases derived from summary hardcopy monthly, quarterly, and annual reports. Thus,"
"there may be discrepancies when comparing the total number of cases reported through different data sources. This application"
"includes data for age, race/ethnicity and gender reported on form CDC 73.2638 reports for years 1996-2002. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#Reporting Issues."
"3. Chlamydia was not reported for all of New York state in years 1996-1999. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#Chlamydia."
"4. Please see help file for specifics about reporting irregularities and population data. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#About Rates."
"5. The denominator population used to compute the overall U.S. rate varies from year to year and from disease to disease, due to"
"changes in reporting status for specific diseases and locations. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#Reporting Issues."
"6. The denominator populations for the United States shown are the bridged-race postcensal July 1st population estimates for the"
"years 2000-2009 and 2011-2013, the bridged-race April 1st, 2010 estimates, and the bridged-race intracensal July 1st population"
"estimates for years 1990-1999, as published by NCHS. The rates shown here may differ somewhat from previous publications, due to"
"differences in the denominator population. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#Population."
"7. Impact of reported cases with missing demographic data on STD rates: when reviewing STD rates by demographic subgroup, e.g.,"
"by age group, gender, or race/ethnicity, note the number and percentage of reported STD cases that have missing data for the"
"subgroup of interest. Rates by age group, gender, or race/ethnicity are calculated using only cases with known information in"
"the numerator divided by the comparable U.S. Census population by year and subgroup. When information is unknown, the cases do"
"not contribute to the numerator and therefore subgroup-specific rates are underestimates of the actual subgroup rate."
"8. Counts and rates shown for the ""All"" age groups category represent cases for all ages and persons of unknown age. More"
"information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#About Rates."
"9. Race categories presented in these data are ""bridged-race"" categories and may differ from race categories in other STD"
"reports. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/std-race-age-frame.html#Population."
