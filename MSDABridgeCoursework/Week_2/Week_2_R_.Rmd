##### Due end of day on Sunday July 12th. 
###### Please work alone on this assignment. Please place your solution in a single R Markdown (.Rmd) file in your GitHub repository, and provide the URL in your assignment link.


In probability, "n choose r" means `n! / (( n - r)! * r!)`.
For example, "5 choose 3" evaluates to 10.
R has built in functions for `choose()` and `factorial()`. Your task is to write your own variation of the `choose()`
function, that does not use either of these functions.
Your code should adhere to the style guidelines provided by Hadley Wickham in this week's reading.
You need to create your code and some test code, and deliver your code, results, and documentation in a single R
Markdown file.


#### Function to calculate n! / (( n - r)! * r!)


```{r}

prob.choose <- function(n,choose) {   

   # This function calculates the following equation n! / (( n - r)! * r!) 
   # It will determine the probability of combinations
   
    n <- n 
    k <- (n-choose)
    r <- choose
   
     if (n > r) {
     f <- 1 
     for (i in 1:n) { 
       f <- f * i 
      }
     n <- f 
     t <- 1
     for (s in 1:k) { 
       t <- t * s 
      }
     k <- t 
     y <- 1
     for (u in 1:r) { 
       y <- y * u 
      }
     r <- y
     answer <- n/(k*r)
     } else if (n == r) {
       answer <- 1
     } else {
       answer <- 0
    }
   print(answer)
 }

prob.choose(5,choose = 3)
```
