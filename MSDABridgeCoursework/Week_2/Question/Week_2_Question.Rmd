I am new to R and trying out using rpart. I am trying to run the below code from the HairEyeColor dataset just to get a sense of the results


```{r}
library(rpart)

x <- data.frame(HairEyeColor)

y <- rpart(Sex ~ Hair + Eye + Freq , method = class, data = x)

y

```

But when I run the code I get the following `error in as.character(x): ` error and I can not figure out why:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
> library(rpart)
> x <- data.frame(HairEyeColor)
> y <- rpart(Sex ~ Hair + Eye + Freq , method = class, data = x)
Error in as.character(x) : 
  cannot coerce type 'builtin' to vector of type 'character'
> y
Error: object 'y' not found
```
