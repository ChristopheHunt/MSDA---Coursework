Jeffrey Nieman proposed some interesting questions related to calorie intake of those that eat out compared to those that do not. I find the subject very interesting as well so I chose his data set to inspect. 

Jeffrey extracted the data from this [page](http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/1112/Table_53_RST_GEN_11.pdf) and provided a nice csv file. Many thanks to Jeffrey. 

```{r}
cal.url <- file(paste(url,"calories and restaurants - Jeffrey Nieman.csv", sep = ""), open="r" )
cal.intake <- read.csv(cal.url, sep=",", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```
