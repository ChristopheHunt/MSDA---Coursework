## NoSQL Database 

My NoSQL database of chose for this assignment is MongoDB. I find it to be a quick and simple solution plus it seems to be an industry leader for NoSQL.

The data set we will be pulling is the Details of Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City provided by the Police Department (NYPD). This dataset is important as part of NYC Mayor De Blasio's Vision Zero Program to reduce traffic related injuries and death. 

> The primary mission of government is to protect the public. New York's families deserve and expect safe streets. But today in New York, approximately 4,000 New Yorkers are seriously injured and more than 250 are killed each year in traffic crashes. Being struck by a vehicle is the leading cause of injury-related death for children under 14, and the second leading cause for seniors. On average, vehicles seriously injure or kill a New Yorker every two hours.

You can learn more about Vision Zero [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/home/home.shtml)

### Getting the Data. 

The below snippet will not knit so you would need to run this code separately on your machine to load the dataset. The download is ~140Mb and will take several minutes using NYC's open data portal, so keep that in mind before running. 

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
library(mongolite)
destfile <- file.path("C:","Users", "Christophe","Documents","traffic_accidents.csv")
traffic_accidents <- read.csv(destfile)
destfile <- "traffic_accidents.csv"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
destfile <- "traffic_accidents.csv"
if(file.exists(destfile)){
  stop(sprintf("%s already exists in %s", destfile, getwd()))
  }
file_to_download <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/h9gi-nx95/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
download.file(file_to_download, destfile=destfile)
traffic_accidents <- read.csv(destfile)
file.remove(destfile)
```

### MongoDB

I am assuming you have already installed MongoDB but if you haven't you will need to navigate to [MongoDB and download the latest version](https://www.mongodb.org/). After installation of MongoDB you will need to follow the next steps and open a connection.

After installation.   

Open a command prompt window in the `bin` folder containing `MongoDB` and type `mongod` to start a connection.

In a new command prompt window in the same `bin` folder type `mongo` and continue to the next section to create our new collection.

### Creating MongoDB collection

Let's create a `Traffic Accidents` collection and pull some data to make sure we have the appropriate setup.

```{r, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
library(mongolite)
m <- mongo(collection = "traffic_accidents")
if (m$count()>0)(m$drop())
names(traffic_accidents) <- gsub("[.]","", names(traffic_accidents)) 
m$insert(traffic_accidents)
```

Checking the results of our inserts

```{r, results = 'asis'}
sprintf("%s rows were inserted out of %s from %s", m$count(), nrow(traffic_accidents), destfile) 
```

Looks like we were able to add all of our information, now lets work with data to investigate some of the traffic accidents. 

### Results 

Let's see if there is any clustering with multiple person traffic injuries in Manhattan. We will get all traffic accidents with more than 4 people being injured and map it to see if any pattern emerges. The number of people injured is arbitrary, if we use fewer than 4 people there are too many points on the graph to make much sense of it. 

```{r, results = 'hide'}
out <- m$find('{"BOROUGH" : "MANHATTAN", "NUMBEROFPERSONSINJURED" : { "$gt" : 4} }')
```

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(out) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.Toner") %>% 
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(), 
             lng = ~LONGITUDE, lat = ~LATITUDE, 
             popup = paste("Reason:", as.character(out$CONTRIBUTINGFACTORVEHICLE1), "<br>", 
                           "# of People Injured:", as.character(out$NUMBEROFPERSONSINJURED), "<br>",
                           "Date of Accident:", as.character(out$DATE))) 
  
```

Interestingly, we see a large cluster of many injury accidents in East Harlem. I can't necessarily tell if there is any particular reason but more research would be necessary to determine the cause or if the number is significant compared to other locations. 


### Lesson Learned with NoSQL

The data set we used is very large at ~145mb and with a relational database, I think we could definitely reduce the size of the file. For instance, if we look at the unique counts of some of the fields we can see that we are storing a lot of unnecessary information in our MongoDB collection. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
length(m$distinct("CONTRIBUTINGFACTORVEHICLE1"))
m$count(query = '{"CONTRIBUTINGFACTORVEHICLE1"}')
m$aggregate('[{"CONTRIBUTINGFACTORVEHICLE1":')
```


### Clean up

```{r}
m$drop()
```
