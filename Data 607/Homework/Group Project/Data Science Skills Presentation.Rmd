## Data Science Skills 

As aspiring **Data Scientists** a very common question is *what skills are important in today's market place?*, Data Science has reputation for rapidly changing and so do the tools. Since we all want to be as well trained as possible at the completion of the CUNY MSDA program, we set out to answer "Which skills are the most valued data science skills?". 

Let's begin by looking at what *Data Science* is: 

```{r, results ='asis'}
library(xml2)
library(XML)
library(stringr)
data.science <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science")
data.science.html <- htmlTreeParse(data.science, useInternal = TRUE) 
data.science.text <- unlist(xpathApply(data.science.html, '//body', xmlValue))
gsub("\\[[0-9].+\\]", "", str_trim(str_extract(data.science.text, "Data Science is.+")))
```

## Data Science

Essentially, Data Science is a mix of many fields and diverse skills. It lies at the intersection of math, computer science, and domain expertise.

## Data Science 
While the previous formal definition and visual representation is fine, it is too vague. Data science has many applications in many fields.

If we are ever going to be able to answer our question of **"Which skills are the most valued data science skills?"** and in the process become better **Data Scientists**, we need to find out what these specific skills might be.

Since **Data Science** is fundamentally the process of taking data in any format and gaining insight, it is the perfect process to answer a question about itself.

1. Literature Review - [Shared Sources File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KVKbOD1htOZ3FriMVB9r5w1HE18LWraSTej3TLArDEw/edit?usp=sharing)
      + We reviewed many resources to establish a general idea of valued Data Science skills

2. Sourcing 
      + The best sources were singled out to be scraped for detailed information
      + Three sources proved to yielded the greatest results - Indeed.com, Google Trends, and Kaggle Job Board 
3. Transforming
      + The collective information from the sources was messy and noisy 
      + The pool of words and phrases was processed down to specific skill based words/phrases

4. Visualization
      + Detailed results were converted to an aethestically pleasing and understandable format
