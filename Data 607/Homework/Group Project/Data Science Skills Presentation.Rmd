## Data Science Skills {.smaller}

We set out to answer "Which skills are the most valued data science skills?". As aspiring **Data Scientists** this question is important because we can use the answer to build our skill set with skills that have the most value. 

Let's begin by looking at what *Data Science* is: 

```{r, results ='asis'}
library(xml2)
library(XML)
library(stringr)
data.science <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science")
data.science.html <- htmlTreeParse(data.science, useInternal = TRUE) 
data.science.text <- unlist(xpathApply(data.science.html, '//body', xmlValue))
gsub("\\[[0-9].+\\]", "", str_trim(str_extract(data.science.text, "Data Science is.+")))
```

## Data Science

Essentially, Data Science is a mix of many fields and diverse skills. It lies at the intersection of math, computer science, and domain expertise.

## Data Science

While the previous formal definition and visual representation is fine, it is too vague. Data science has many applications in many fields.

If we are ever going to be able to answer our question of **"Which skills are the most valued data science skills?"** and become better **Data Scientists**, we need to find out what these specific skills might be.

Since **Data Science** is fundamentally the process of taking data in any format and gaining insight, it is the perfect method to answer a question about itself.


## Team Introduction 

To begin we met as team for our project kickoff on 03/14/2016 and divided ourselves into subgroups to tackle this issue. 

We quickly nominated our Team Lead - Jeff Nieman and decided on the subgroups: 

1. Data gathering and sourcing- *"Sourcers"*
      - Dan F., Scott, Arindam, Valerie, Yadu
2. Data assembly and tidying - *"Transformers"*
      - Armenoush, Keith, Dan B., Rob,  Adia
3. Data presentation - *"Presenters"*
      - Antonio, Christophe, Musa, Daniel, Valerie, Yadu, Dan B.
