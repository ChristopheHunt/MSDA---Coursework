## Data Science Skills

We set out to answer "Which skills are the most valued data science skills?". 

Let's begin by looking at what *Data Science* is: 

```{r, results ='asis'}
library(xml2)
library(XML)
library(stringr)
data.science <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science")
data.science.html <- htmlTreeParse(data.science, useInternal = TRUE) 
data.science.text <- unlist(xpathApply(data.science.html, '//body', xmlValue))
gsub("\\[[0-9].+\\]", "", str_trim(str_extract(data.science.text, "Data Science is.+")))
```

## Data Science

Essentially, Data Science is a mix of fields and skills. It is the intersection of math, computer science, and domain expertise.

## Data Science

While the previous formal definitions are fine, they are too vague. 

We need to get at the actual skills most valued in data science. 

Since data science in itself is taking data in any format and gaining insight, it is the perfect tool to answer this question.
