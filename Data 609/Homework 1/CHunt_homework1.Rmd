# Page 8: problem 10

An annuity increases each month by an automatic depost of 1% interest on the previous month's balance. Your grandparents withdraw \$1000 at the beginning of each month for living expenses. Currently, they have \$50,000 in the annuity. Model the annuity with a dynamic system. 

$$\Delta~b_n=\Delta~b_{n+1}-b_n= .01b_n - 1,000$$
$$b_{n+1}=b_n+ .01b_n - 1,000$$
$$b_o = 50,000$$
Will the annuity run out of money? 


```{r}
a_n <- 50000
b_n <- 1000
count <- 0

while (1.01*a_n > 0){
a_n <- a_n + (.01 * a_n) - b_n
count <- count + 1
if (a_n >= 50000){
  print("the annunity will not run out")
  break
 }
}
```

Yes, the code above runs without indicating that the annuity will not run out. This is because our initial amount is decreasing with each sequence so it has a termination point. 

When? The annuity will run out at `r count` months.
