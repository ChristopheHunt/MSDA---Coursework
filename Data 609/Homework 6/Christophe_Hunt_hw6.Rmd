Solve using graphical analysis

Maximize 10x + 35y
subject to 

$$2x + 3y \geq 6$$
$$3x - y \leq 15$$
$$-x + y \leq 4$$
$$2x + y \leq 27$$
$$x \geq 0$$
$$y \geq 0$$

Using teh Simplex Method to resolve the problems. Using the Simplex Method to find both the maximum solution and the minimum solution to Problems 8-12. Assume x $\geq$ 0 and y $\geq$ 0 for each problem.

Maximize 10x + 35y
subject to 

$$2x + 3y \geq 6$$
$$3x - y \leq 15$$
$$-x + y \leq 4$$
$$2x + y \leq 27$$
$$x \geq 0$$
$$y \geq 0$$
