The bridges and land masses of a certain city can be modeled with graph G in figure 8.7. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristopheHunt/MSDA---Coursework/master/Data%20609/Homework%207/bridges.PNG)

## a. is G Eularian? Why or why not?

> No, because there are vertices of odd degrees (2 and 5). 

## b. Suppose we relax the requirement of the walk so that the walker need not start and end at the same land mass but still must traverse every bridge exactly once. Is this type of walk possible in a city modeled by the graph in figure 8.7? If so, how? If not, why not?

> Yes, it is possible to travese each edge once.    
We can start our walk at 2 and then traverse as follows:     
1. 2 to 1   
2. 1 to 3   
3. 3 to 2   
4. 2 to 4    
5. 4 to 5     
6. 5 to 3     
7. 3 to 4     
8. 4 to 6     
9. 6 to 5

Consider the graph in Figure 8.11.

## a. Write down the set of edges E(G)

> $E(G) = \{ab, ae, af, bc, bd, cd, de, df, ef\}$

## b. Which edges are incident with vertex b? 

> ab, bc, and bd

## c. Which vertices are adjacent to vertex c?

> b and d

## d. Compute deg(a)

> deg(a) = {ab, ae, af} = 3

## e. Compute $|E(G)|$

> $|E(G)|= \{ab, ae, af, bc, bd, cd, de, df, ef\} = 9$

A basketball coach needs to find a starting lineup for her team. There are five positions that must be filled: point guard (1), shooting guard (2), swing(3), power forward (4), and center (5). Given the Table 8.7, create a graph model and use it to find a feasible starting lineup. What changes if the coach decides she cant play Hermione in position 3? 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

```{r, fig.width=5}
b_team <- data.frame(from = c('Alice','Alice',
                                 'Bonnie', 
                                 'Courtney', 'Courtney', 
                                 'Deb',  'Deb',  'Deb',
                                 'Ellen', 
                                 'Fay',
                                 'Gladys', 'Gladys',
                                 'Hermione', 'Hermione'),
                        
                        to = c('point guard (1)','shooting guard (2)',
                               'point guard (1)',
                               'point guard (1)','shooting guard (2)',
                               'swing (3)', 'power forward (4)', 'center (5)',
                               'shooting guard (2)',
                               'point guard (1)',
                               'swing (3)', 'power forward (4)',
                               'point guard (1)', 'swing (3)'),
                        weight = c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 ))

df_b_team <- graph.data.frame(b_team, directed=FALSE)
plot(df_b_team,vertex.color="gold", 
     vertex.size=6, 
     asp = .7,
     vertex.frame.color="gray", 
     vertex.label.color="black",  
     edge.curved=0.2)
```

> Using the graph, we can see that a possible lineup is:    
Ellen - Shooting Guard  
Fay - Point Guard   
Hermione - Swing   
Gladys - Power Forward    
Deb - Center   

> If the coach decides she can't play Hermione in position 3 swing, she wont be able to fill the lineup. This is because Deb and Gladys are the only others that can play position 3 but they also are the only ones that can play other positions.

Find a shortest path from node $a$ to node $j4$ in the graph in Figure 8.33 with edge weights shown on the graph. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristopheHunt/MSDA---Coursework/master/Data%20609/Homework%207/problem1.PNG)

```{r}
path <- data.frame(from=c('a','a','b','b','c','c',
                          'd','e','g','f','i','e',
                          'h', 'e'),
                   to =c('b','c','e','d','e','f',
                         'g','g','i','i','j','h',
                         'j','i'),
                        weight = c(2,4,7,2,4,2,
                                   2,1,8,6,2,2,
                                   4,3))

g <- graph.data.frame(path, directed=FALSE)

path_length <- shortest.paths(g, v = 'a', to = 'j')

path_output <- get.shortest.paths(g, 'a', 'j')

path_output$vpath[[1]]
```

The shortest path is `r path_length` and the path is (a b d g e i j).
