Using the definition provided for the movement diagram, determine whether the following zero-sum games have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. If the game does have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, state the Nash equilibrium. Assume the row player is maximizing his playoffs which are showing in the matrices below.

\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{lllc}
 &  & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Colin} \\ \cline{3-4}
 &  & C1 & \multicolumn{1}{l}{C2} \\ \hline
Rose & R1 & \multicolumn{1}{c}{10} & 10 \\
 & R2 & \multicolumn{1}{c}{5} & 0 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
