# Page 529: problem 1

Verify that the given function pair is a solution to the first-order system. 

$x = -e^t$, $y = e^t$       
$\frac{dx}{dt} = -y$, $\frac{dy}{dt} = -x$      

$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(-e^t) = e^t = y$ ; $\frac{dx}{dt} = -y$   

$\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(e^t) = -e^t = x$ ; $\frac{dy}{dt} = -x$   

# Page 529: problem 6

Find and classify the rest points of the given autonomous system. 

$\frac{dx}{dt} = -(y-1)$, $\frac{dy}{dt} = x-2$

The rest point of the system is a point in the phase plane for which $f(x,y) = 0 and g(x,y) = 0$, then both the derivatives $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}= 0$. 

when $y = 1$, $\frac{dx}{dt} = -(1-1)$; $\frac{dx}{dt}= 0$    
when $x = 2$, $\frac{dy}{dt} = 2 - 2$; $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$   

$(2,1)$ is the rest point of the autonomous system $\frac{dx}{dt} = -(y-1)$, $\frac{dy}{dt} = x-2$

Apply the first and second derivative tests to the function 
$f(y) = y^a/e^{by}$ to show that $f(y) = y^a/e^{by}$ is a unique critical point that yields the relative maximum $f(a/b)$. Show also that $f(y)$ approaches zero as y tends to infinity. 

first derivative test 

$\frac{d(\frac{y^a}{e^{by}})}{dy} = 0$      
$\frac{e^{by}ay^{a-1}-y^abe^{by}}{e^{2by}}=0$      


$e^{by}ay^{a-1}(a-yb) = 0$
Since $e^{by}$ cannot be zero :
$y = \frac{a}{b}~or~y =0$

Second derivative test 

$\frac{d^2f(y)}{dy^2} = \frac{d\frac{ay^{a-1}-y^ab}{e^{by}}}{dy}$    
$\frac{d^2f(y)}{dy^2} = \frac{e^{by}\{a(a-1)y^{a-2}-ay{a-1}\}-(ay^{a-1}-y^a)be^{by}}{e^{2by}}$


Substitute the value of 0 :

$\frac{d^2f(y)}{dy^2} = 0$

Substitute the value of $y=\frac{a}{b}$

$\frac{d^2f(y)}{dy^2} = \frac{(\frac{a}{b})^{a-2}x-a}{e^a}$


As $a$ and $b$ are positive constants, the second derivative is less than zero and hence it is poroved that $y=\frac{a}{b}$ is a unique critical point that yields the relative maximum.
