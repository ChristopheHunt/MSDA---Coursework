Consider a model for the long-term dining behavior of the students at College USA. It is found that 25% of the students who eat at the college's Grease Dining Hall return to eat there again, whereas those who eat at Sweet Dining Hall have a 93% return rate. These are the only two dining halls available on campus, and assume that all students eat at a one of these halls. Formulate a model to solve for the long-term percentage of students eating at each hall.


\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Present - Next State for Dining}
\label{Present - Next State for Dining}
\begin{tabular}{cl|cc|}
\cline{3-4}
 &  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{NEXT STATE} \\ \cline{3-4} 
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} &  & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Grease Dinning Hall} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Sweet Dining Hall} \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\multirow{2}{*}{PRESENT STATE}} & Grease Dining Hall & .25 & .75 \\
\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & Sweet Dining Hall & .7 & .93 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Model to solve for long-term percentage 
$$Grease_{n+1} = .25~Grease_n + .7~Sweet_N$$
$$Sweet_{n+1} = .75~Grease_n + .93~Sweet_N$$

Consider a stereo with CD player, FM-AM radio tuner, speakers (dual) and power amplifier (PA) components, as displayed with the reliability. Determine the system's reliability. what assumptions are required in your model?

Compenent Reliability
$$R_{s1} = 0.95$$
$$R_{s2} = 0.98 + .97 - (.98 * .97) = `r (0.98 +.97) - (.98 * .97)`$$
$$R_{s3} = .99 + .99 - (.99 * .99) = `r (.99 + .99) - (.99 * .99)`$$
Entire system reliability:

$$R_{s1, s2, s3} = .95 * `r (0.98 +.97) - (.98 * .97)` * `r .99 + .99 - (.99 * .99)` = `r .95 * ((0.98 +.97) - (.98 * .97)) * ((.99 + .99) - (.99 * .99))`$$

Use the basic linear model y = ax + b to fit the following data sets. Provide the model, provide the values of SEE, SSR, SST, and R^2, and provide a residual plot.

```{r}
height <- c(60:80)
weight <- c(132, 136, 141, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 
            175, 180, 185, 190, 195, 201, 206, 212, 218, 
            223, 229, 234)
```

```{r}
slope <- function(x,y){
return(((length(x)*sum(x*y)) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / 
       ((length(x)*sum(x^2)) - sum(x)^2))
     }
slope(x = height, y = weight)
```

```{r}
intercept <- function(x,y){
  (sum(x^2)*sum(y) - sum(x*y)*sum(x)) /
  ((length(x)*sum(x^2)) - sum(x)^2)
}
intercept(x = height, y = weight)
```

The linear model y = ax + b for this data set is $y_{weight} = `r round(slope(x = height, y = weight),2)`x_{height} `r round(intercept(x = height, y = weight),2)`

We can verify the results with the `lm` function in `base R`.

```{r, results='asis'}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(lm(weight ~ height))
```
