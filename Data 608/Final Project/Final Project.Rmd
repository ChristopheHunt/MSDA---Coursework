A national survey was conducted by Pew Research Center in conjunction with Smithsonian magazine between February 13-18, 2014 by landline and cell phones among 1,001 adults. The objective of the survey was to better understand US views towards scientific and technological changes occurring during this time period. Understanding public perception of the many scientific changes occurring in the US is important to understand how Americans view their place in a changing environment and if they are hopeful or anxious about the future.   

The scientific and technological changes are varied and include some issues currently being discussed today, such as "would you ride in a driver-less car?". In the below table we see that `r percent(514/1001)` of individuals in the survey were willing to ride in a driver-less car. 

```{r table of would you ride in a driverless car, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
dataset$pial4b <- gsub("\\()", "", gsub("(VOL.)", "", gsub("â???T", "'", dataset$pial4b)))
pander::pandoc.table(rev(table(dataset$pial4b)))
```

However, if we look at a map of a recent analysis by [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state) <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> we see that the most common job in most states is truck driver. This type of employment may be made obsolete as more and more individuals being comfortable with driver-less vehicles. Unfortunately, changes and comfort with driverless cars will inevitably lead to driverless trucks. It would seem that maybe we see regional differences in views of certains technologies and the employment types. For instance,
