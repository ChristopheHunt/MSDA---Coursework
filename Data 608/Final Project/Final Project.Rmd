A national survey was conducted by Pew Research Center in conjunction with Smithsonian magazine between February 13-18, 2014 by landline and cell phones among 1,001 adults. The objective of the survey was to better understand US views towards scientific and technological changes and how they viewed the future. Understanding public perception of these types of changes occurring in the US is important to understand how Americans view their place in the changing environment and if they are hopeful or anxious about the future.   

The questions regarding scientific and technological changes were varied and include some issues currently being discussed today, such as "would you ride in a driver-less car?". In the below table we see that `r percent(514/1001)` of individuals in the survey were willing to ride in a driver-less car. 

```{r table of would you ride in a driverless car, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
pander::pandoc.table(rev(table(survey.data$pial4b)), caption = "Pew Research Question : would you ride in a driver-less car?")
```

However, if we look at a map of a recent analysis by [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state) <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> on census data of the same time period we see that the most common job in most states is truck driver. This type of employment may be made obsolete as more and more individuals become comfortable with driver-less vehicles. Unfortunately, changes and comfort with driver-less cars will inevitably lead to driver-less trucks.

## Regional Differences 

It would seem that perhaps we will see regional differences in views of certain technologies and the employment types. For instance, in the census region `South` nearly every state has the greatest occupation as Truck Driver except for Florida which has Primary School Teacher. Let's see the ratio of positive views to negative views for this question by region.

Interestingly, we do see a higher ratio of people that would not ride in a driverless car regions were most individuals are trucker drivers. It does seem that there is a correlation with a negative response to a question that threatens the predominate occupation in a region. 

Below are two graphs, the one on the left is the ratio of people that said No to Yes for a region. On the right is a graph of the percentage of the population that is employed in a particular sector. Perhaps there are further correlations between certain questions regarding optimism of future technology and certain employment sectors.
