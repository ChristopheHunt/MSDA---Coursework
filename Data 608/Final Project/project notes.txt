Research Model development for data set

Data Acquisition and Transformation – Christophe 


Reduce the data set to 2015 and top 5 liquors, top 5 counties. 

Get out smaller data set. 

Senthil and Yadu - model on smaller data set and the research by choice of model. 
			MLR - Poisson, target is volume sold. 
                 Second target is average sale price by county by bottles sold.   


objective is to develop a model for both the bottles sold and the margin for the holiday month of november 2014 (training) and november 2015 (test).  

In Des Moines in Iowa, we want to predict bottles sold of whiskey (as a whiskey company) in the holiday month of November, 
the stores (storeID) and we have Vendor Name, Pack (in case pack size influences sales), bottle volume (people looking for deals) 
state bottle cost (how much to procure), state bottle retail (how much we sell for), Sale Dollars (total sales) 
Volume (gallons), profit margin (calcuate for the business problem). 

bottles sold - dependent variable (how well we perform).
